//! The sandbox published apps run their server-side code in.
//!
//! Three limits matter, and none of them are advisory:
//!
//! * **fuel** — a hard ceiling on executed instructions, so an infinite loop
//!   dies deterministically rather than pinning a core.
//! * **epochs** — wall-clock deadline, which catches guests that block without
//!   burning fuel. Each tick checks the deadline against the clock rather
//!   than counting ticks, which run slow on a loaded host. Epochs only
//!   interrupt wasm, so every host import that can wait (a wasi sleep, a
//!   query, a fetch) is cut off at the same deadline.
//! * **memory** — a cap enforced when the guest asks to grow, counting its
//!   tables as well as its linear memory.
//!
//! A store is built fresh per request. Reusing one would leak state between
//! requests, and app state belongs in that app's database instead. The one
//! exception is an app that asks to run resident: `Resident` is one store
//! kept for all of its connection events, under the same guards per call.
